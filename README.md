Let's delve into the key features and benefits of your website:

1. User-Friendly Interface:
   Your task management website boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap frontend technologies provide a visually appealing design with responsive elements, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

2. Task Creation and Organization:

Users can easily search for specific tasks based on various parameters, such as task name, due date, priority, or completion status. Sorting options allow users to organize tasks based on different criteria, such as due date or priority level.

5. Reminders and Notifications:
   Your website supports reminders and notifications to keep users informed about upcoming deadlines or task updates. Leveraging Java on the backend, you can implement notification mechanisms, such as email alerts or push notifications, to ensure users stay on top of their tasks.
